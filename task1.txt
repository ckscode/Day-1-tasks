HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)

HTTP1.1 and HTTP2 are versions of HTTP that manages the transfer of data from the browser to server and vice versa
lets see..
Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2

TCP CONNECTIONS
HTTP1.1:
Has more than one TCP(transmission Control Protocol),3-6 connection in later versions of it.
TCP is like a pipeline which will be created between the server and client(browser) to transfer request and responses.
HTTP2:
Has single TCP connections

MULTIPLEXING
HTTP1.1:
One connection per request.The next request slows down until the first response is sent
HTTP2:
Uses multiplexing which allows multiple request under single TCP

BINARY PROTOCOL
HTTP1.1:
Uses texual format of data for communication
HTTP2:
Uses binary data format for communication(increases efficiency)

HEADER HANDLING
HTTP1.1:
headers are sent repeatedly for each request and response even while requesting to the
same server 
HTTP2:
includes header compression, which reduces size of data and time consumed by compressing 
repeated headers

STREAM PRORITIZING
HTTP1.1:
Client cannot prioritize the certain stream or resources they want.  
HTTP2:
This allows to prioritize individual resources which enables efficient
resource allocation ensuring critical resources are downloaded first.

SERVER PUSH
HTTP1.1:
Does not have server push feature.The required resources are fetched only after 
first auto request is sent to the server .This increases the load time.
HTTP2:
Has server push feature which proactively pushes the resources to the clients
before the request reduing the loading time and eliminating the round trip of 
fetching required resources again after request
