--Object In Javascript--

Object is one of the data types in Javascript.It has a variable name and the contents are 
present inside curly braces.This contents are represented in a key(string) value pair,this pair is called as a "Property".

This represents and Object:

var car = {
     Modelname:"sedan",
     color:"red"
}

in the above example car is the variable of the object.Inside the variable the the string BEFORE THE COLON is the "key"
and the content which comes AFTER THE COLON is the "value".
*Key mostly can be a string or numbers for easy accessibility.
*Value can be of any data type,even an other object and also a function or anything which can be set into a variable.

To access the data inside the object 
One method is--
variable.key can be given 
In the above example to print the model name of the variable "car" in console

Console.log(car.Modelname) //OUTPUT: sedan

Another method--
variable[key] can be given
*key must be represented based on its type
if the key is a string // variable["key"] //with the bracket notation
if the key is a number // variable[key]


//These are some of the characteristics of Objects

There is another feature called Object Prototyping where one object can get the Properties of another object

example:

var car = {
    Modelname:"sedan",
    color:"red",
    69:"position"
}

var bus = {
    size:28
}

Object.setPrototypeOf(bus, car);

console.log(bus.color) //OUTPUT: red
console.log(car.size) //OUTPUT: undefined


In the above example the bus' prototype is set to the "car",hence it got the properties of car object
it cannot happend in reverse.
